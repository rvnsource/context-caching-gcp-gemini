The code stores large research papers (or other input data) in a context cache(using gemini) to avoid repeatedly sending the same data to the model in future requests.
This helps reduce the number of tokens processed and thus lowers the cost and speeds up processing.
The code shows how to create, update, and delete cached content, allowing you to control the time-to-live (TTL) and remove the cache when itâ€™s no longer needed.

Querying methods:-
1) It demonstrates how to use the cached content in subsequent API calls or
2) chat sessions to perform tasks like answering questions or generating content based on the stored documents.

           (the 3rd file is my private file path. I created a private bucket for my private file in google Storage 
            for this purpose.)

*** Finally don't forget to delete the bucket and context cache that you created for this purpose.

Key steps:-
# Step 1: Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project genai-434714

# Step 2: Create a Google Cloud Storage Bucket (Private Bucket Example)
gsutil mb -l us-central1 gs://ravi-my-private-bucket/

# Step 3: Upload Files to the Private Bucket
gsutil cp ./John_P-Doe_Demo_fee_estimate_2023-converted.pdf gs://ravi-my-private-bucket/

# Step 4: Verify File Upload to Private Bucket
gsutil ls gs://ravi-my-private-bucket/

# Step 5: Create a Public Bucket (Optional, if you want public access)
gsutil mb -l us-central1 gs://ravi-my-public-bucket/

# Step 6: Upload Files to the Public Bucket (Optional)
gsutil cp ./John_P-Doe_Demo_fee_estimate_2023-converted.pdf gs://ravi-my-public-bucket/

# Step 7: Make the Specific File Public (Only for Public Bucket)
gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://ravi-my-public-bucket/John_P-Doe_Demo_fee_estimate_2023-converted.pdf

# Step 8: Get the Public URL for the File
https://storage.googleapis.com/ravi-my-public-bucket/John_P-Doe_Demo_fee_estimate_2023-converted.pdf

# Step 9: Download a File from the Private Bucket
gsutil cp gs://ravi-my-private-bucket/John_P-Doe_Demo_fee_estimate_2023-converted.pdf ./local-directory/

# Step 10: Make the Entire Public Bucket Public (Optional)
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://ravi-my-public-bucket/

# Step 11: Check IAM Permissions of the Private Bucket
gsutil iam get gs://ravi-my-private-bucket/
